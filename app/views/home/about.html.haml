	%p Welcome to Noteworks. Noteworks is my senior project for the Trinity College Computer Science Department, based on my desire to improve the way most people take notes. Note-taking is an incredibly common practice that, for many people, hasn't changed much since the advent of personal computing. Physical notes are severely limited by their medium, and for the most part, digital notes suffer many of the same weaknesses. As a result, they can be difficult to maintain, and even more difficult to study from. To resolve this, I created Noteworks, a web application designed to let users take cleaner, better organized, and more usable notes. The application works by allowing a user to type in notes with a simple markup language I designed. The backend then parses these notes, breaks them down, and allows the frontend to present the user with a graph of their data, which is generated by a force-directed graph drawing algorithm. The user is able to interact with this graph by moving its elements around as necessary, and can update it in real time by simply modifying the notes that they've taken. The computation for the app was written in Ruby (with the Ruby on Rails web framework) on the backend and JavaScript on the frontend. Noteworks works, turning notes that may have otherwise been unusable into an easy to engage with, dynamic, and well organized network of information.
