				%h2 Write Simple
				%p Easy markup. No fuss, no must. You can write your notes almost exactly like you always do, but if you want to really get things going, our additions only take a few minutes to learn.
			.large-4.small-12.columns.command-graph{"data-equalizer-watch" => true}
				%h2 Graphic
				%p Your notes, our graph. You type your notes in, and it draws a graph for you (look up - there's an example.)
			.large-4.small-12.columns.command-flexible{"data-equalizer-watch" => true}
				%h2 Anything Goes
				%p Want to write class notes? Easy. Want hash out your plans for world domination? Equally easy (though you might want to make those private.)
